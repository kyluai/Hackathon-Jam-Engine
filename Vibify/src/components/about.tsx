                We're two friends who have both been coding since high school, bonding over our shared interest for technology and music. 
                What began as simple coding projects evolved into a deep passion for creating tools that bring people together through music.

                The Jam Engine was born during this hackathon when we were struggling to find the perfect song to play while brainstorming ideas. 
                We realized there had to be a better way to discover music that matches your current vibe or activity. 
                That's when we decided to build something that would help people find the perfect soundtrack for any moment.
